    )['data']['id']

# Next we need to add bands. The core function of a band is to tell us how data
# is encoded in the imagery that you are going to upload. For these building
# masks there is only one file per scene, and each scene has one 8 bit band.

band_id = catalog.add_band(

# Now we want to add some actual imagery to our catalog. We will use the

# method will not return any information about when the image will be uploaded.
# For now you can use the metadata image searching functions to determine that your
# imagery has been processed.

# of internal caching you will need to wait about 1 minute for your band
# changes to take effect in calls to raster..

# If you want to use your own color map you can, but you have to put it into
# a form we can understand. The general form is a list where each item is a map to
# the appropriate colorspace for the pixel value at that items index. Of course this only
# makes sense if the dtype is integral (not Float32).

# Maybe you play around with your new product and decide it has a wider appeal.
# Lets share the product with some other folks.

catalog.change_product(product_id, read=['some:group'])

# WAIT, by default we have only set permissions for the product, not the bands
# and images that belong to it. To do that we need to take advantage of the
# set_global_permissions flag on the `change_product` method.

catalog.change_product(product_id, read=['some:group'], set_global_permissions=True)

# Don't worry if all your imagery isn't available to the new read group immediately.
# The update is handled in the background, so you don't have to wait for a (potentially long)
# time for your request to return, depending how many images need to be changed.


# Finally if you decide you are done with this layer and want to clean it up,
# use the remove_* methods. You aren't allowed to delete a product that has
# imagery or bands attached, because this would orphan those documents, and make
# them inaccessible.
